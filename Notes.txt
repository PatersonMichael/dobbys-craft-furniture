Need to add:
1. Cart
    i. cart visuals
        a. offcanvas popup on click OR if an item is in cart, display popup
        b. display list of items: ITEM NAME:        $PRICE
        c. cart items counter
        d. checkout function: Checkout Button, subtotal, tax, total
        e. Quantity button
        f. Delete button
    ii. cart functionality
        a. when "Add to Cart" is clicked, adds data from target to a new item, populates cart.
            1. creates instance of "Product Item" class (see below)
            2. adds item to cart display
            3. adds item price to subtotal
            4. adds item to Cart Object
            5. checks if item already exists in cart
                i. If there is already an item, add one to the quantity of that item in the cart.
                ii. If not, add a new instance of that item to the cart.
        b. displays subtotal, tax, total
            1. subtotal = sum of prices of all items in cart
            2. tax: CA sales tax = 0.0725
            3. total = subtotal + (subotal * tax)
        c. Quantity button
            1. Quantity multiplies the number of instances of that item
            2. In a fuller app, would tell the business the specific quantity of that item needed to be pulled from inventory and shipped. For now: only multiply item price by quantity for subotal calculation.
        d. Delete button
            1. Removes that item from the cart
                i. delete the instance of the Product item
                ii. subtract the item's price from subtotal.
                iii. removes the item from Cart Object
        e. Cart Object
            1. Stores Product Items Data
                ex: Cart {
                    item1: {
                        name: "name",
                        price: priceFloat,
                        qty: qtyInt
                    },
                    item2: {...}
                }
            2. Store this data in local storage?
            3. Could run a forEach, and use the data from here to populate the shopping cart's html?    
                i. something like: forEach item create a new HTML element in the shopping cart that houses the item name and price: `<p class="cart-item"><span class="cart-item-name">${itemName}</span><span class="cart-item-price">${itemPrice}</span></p>`

2. Product item
    i. Product item visuals
        a. Display a card for product
            1. card-image
            2. card-title
            3. card-text
            4. card-price
            5. add to cart button
    ii. Product item functionality
        a. create a class for "Product items"
            1. Goal is to use Product item data to populate the shopping cart.
            2. Create variables for:
                i. Item name
                ii. Item price 
        b. on clicking the target item's "add to cart" button:
            1. construct a new "Product item"
                i. Item name = data from target's card-title
                ii. Item price = data from target's card-price



THINGS THAT HAPPENED DURING DEVELOPMENT:

found out how the .find method works
using a dataset's "id" helps to keep track of data that's being reused across the program

discovered that my code that populates the shopping cart with "new items" can be used when removing data as well, moved it to its own function called updateShoppingCart().
